# TPH Spotlight

A project that encompasses all of the upcoming TPH Spotlights


### How it works

1. Contribute a markdown file that contains an overview of a technology.
2. Demonstrate in this that you can explain the technology effectively and 
   that it's something worth knowing about.
3. Wait for a slot on the server. We do spotlights in maximum 1 time per month.
4. A channel called what-is-java, for example, will be made to highlight a java
   spotlight. 


### Technology & Spotlight requirements
- It is required to have at least 2 people who can technology champion a 
  technology (it is preferable to have 3)
- The document must be approved by 2 TPH admins
- The technology must not have been spotlighted in the last 6 months
- The spotlight should indicate what the technology is good at, at least in its
  own view. It should not attempt to indicate half-truths e.g.
  "go is the only option for concurrency". Go is a good option for concurrency 
  problems, but not the only one. 

### Notes

- New spotlights should be called tech_name.md and placed in proposals/
- Old spotlights will be moved to archive/
